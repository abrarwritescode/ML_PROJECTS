# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains a collection of machine learning models developed to solve various tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of different machine learning algorithms to address real-world problems. Each of these project gave me a clear understanding of how real world machine learning projects works and better understanding of the problem

## Key Projects

### 1. Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Predicting the price of cars based on various features of the cars.

### 2. Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering
Segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing behavior,income, Spending score using k-means clustering.


### 3. Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression

Predicting the likelihood of heart disease based on patient characteristics and medical attributes using logistic regression.
